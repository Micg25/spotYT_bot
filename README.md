# spotYT_bot
A telegram bot that allows you to download: tracks, albums and even your playlists from Youtube and Spotify.
It uses Youtube API to find each song, on the Spotify side it's used only to retreive the metadata that will be crunched by the Youtube APIs to find the exact song.
Finally each song is downloaded with yt_dlp.
